# Project: Linear Equations Solver

## About

You’ve come so far! Yet sometimes it’s nice to get back to old and simple basics: shall we remember some linear algebra? In this project, you will write a program that solves linear equations (you wish you had it back at school, don’t you?) It won’t be working with powers and radicals, but on the other hand, it will be able to handle matrices and complex numbers.

## Learning outcomes

Practice the ever-useful essentials (classes, arrays, files) and learn to handle complex numbers and matrices.

## What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
- Start with real numbers and simple equations of (a*x = b) type. 
- Let’s get serious: enable the program to solve systems with two variables. 
- Practice working with multidimensional arrays, files and the command line: get data from a file and solve multiple linear equations 
- Learn to handle special cases where there is no or infinite possible solutions for the equations. 
- Finally, teach your program to solve equations with complex numbers.
